# Tech Ed Satellite Simulator
Compile and upload the code in this repo to any PlatformIO supported ESP32 board to have a server to make the ESP32 send UART commands to the adcs and collect data from the ADCS over the air.

The best part of this code is that it is based on the Arduino platform and generic ESP32 libraries so that it can theoretically be compiled for any ESP32 family board supported by PlatformIO! Compile anywhere, run on anything (hopefully).

# Usage
1. Clone this repo. `git clone https://github.com/Idaho-ADCS/satellite-simulator`
2. Install [Platform IO](https://platformio.org/install)
2. Build and upload to an ESP32 board of your choice!
